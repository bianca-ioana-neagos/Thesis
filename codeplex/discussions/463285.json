Perhaps SelectMany is not the right method to do what we are trying...could you help us on that please ?\r<br />\n<br />\nFor the context, we try to build dynamically this query (using Linq.Expressions), that's why we need a way to write this query with SelectMany or whatever method...)\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks<br />\n",
