    "Description": "The urls used in the TwitterInput.cs GetURL() method need to use https:// rather than http:// as per the twitter streaming api documentation (https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-api).  With the http:// urls you will get a WebException (\"Unable to connect to the remote server\") at the \"var response = request.GetResponse();\" line of code.  The WebException has an inner SocketException with the message \"No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it x.x.x.x:p\".  Changing the Url strings in the GetURL() method to https:// fixes the problem (at least for me).",
