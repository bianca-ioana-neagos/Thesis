<div class="wikidoc"><h1>StreamInsight V2.1</h1>To demonstrate the new APIs in <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=253700">StreamInsight V2.1</a>, we have created the <a href="https://streaminsight.codeplex.com/releases/view/90143">StreamInsight Product Team Samples V2.1</a> that co-exist with the samples for previous versions (V2.0 and below).<br /><br /><table><tr><th>Application</th><th>Purpose</th></tr>
<tr><td>HelloWorld</td><td>Simple StreamInsight application to get started.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ComposingQueries</td><td>Shows how to compose queries in comparison with the same application in the V2.0 sample set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ComposingQueriesNoAdapter</td><td>Same as above, but using .Net sequence integration instead of adapters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Checkpointing</td><td>Shows how to take checkpoints and recover from interruptions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hitchhiker_V21</td><td>Accompanies the updated version of the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=256236">Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to StreamInsight Queries</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UdsoPatternDetector</td><td>Demonstrates how to use a User-defined StreamOperator (UDSO) to implement a complex pattern detection scenario.</td></tr>

<h1>StreamInsight V2.0</h1>The <a href="https://streaminsight.codeplex.com/releases/view/46435">Microsoft StreamInsight Product Team Samples V2.0</a> are demonstrating key aspects of the StreamInsight CEP platform. The purpose of the samples is to provide a guide through the StreamInsight development experience, demonstrating common design patterns for adapters, queries, and applications. The emphasis is on the teaching character, not on feature completeness, performance, or robustness. <a href="http://twitter.com/streaminsight">Follow the product team on Twitter</a> for latest updates.<br /><br />The samples consist of a set of Visual Studio Solutions, each of which contains at least one input adapter, one output adapter, and one main application. Each adapter is a separate projects and can be included in multiple solutions.<br /><br /><table><tr><th>Adapter</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Teaching Value</th><th>VS Version</th></tr>
